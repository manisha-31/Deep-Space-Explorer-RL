# 🚀 Deep Space Explorer – Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Navigation

## 📌 Project Overview
**Deep Space Explorer** implements a **Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent** for **autonomous spacecraft navigation** in a simulated space environment.  
The agent learns to:  
- **Optimize fuel usage**  
- **Avoid obstacles**  
- **Reach its goal efficiently**  

We use the **Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm with PPO enhancements** to train the agent, enabling **adaptive decision-making** in dynamic and uncertain space conditions.
